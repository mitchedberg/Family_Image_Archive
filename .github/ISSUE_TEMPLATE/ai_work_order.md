# Context

# Allowed paths/files
- 

# Acceptance criteria
- [ ] 

# Validation commands
```bash
# Example (edit to match task)

# Diff budget
Keep the PR small and focused. If changes exceed ~200 lines or touch multiple behaviors, split into separate issues.

# Notes for agent
- Read `REPO_MAP.md`, then `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` before editing.
- Do not create or modify `CLAUDE.md`.
- Follow any legacy snapshot and PR-order requirements in `AGENTS.md`.
